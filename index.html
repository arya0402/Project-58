        <p> Soccer is all about teamwork. Kicking a ball is a lot of fun. I play soccer at Westmont. Soccer gives a lot of excerise.

            Soccer in the United States is run by different organizations. The United States Soccer Federation governs most levels of soccer in the country, including the national teams, professional leagues, and amateur leagues. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) governs colleges and the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) governs schools. The match regulations are generally the same between the three governing bodies although there are many subtle differences.
            <br><br>
            As of May 2015, over 24.4 million people play soccer in the United States. In 2017, Gallup reported that soccer was the third-most watched team sport in the U.S., behind only basketball and American football. The popularity of the sport in the U.S. has been growing since the late 1960s and received a significant boost when the United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup. It is the fourth most popular sport in the United States behind American football, baseball, and basketball.

            That is all about Soccer.
